### AutoPost in shoutbox rooms (socket)

Simple go program which can be useful for sellers and users at cracked.io, easy to manage check the `config.json`.
> [!CAUTION]
Just to clarify that I am not to blame if you get banned or something similar due to automation on their forum, I made the software and gave it to you for free. It is up to you how you use it. As for the 'ws_token', it is also up to you (you can manually find it over session or do some kind of grabber)

> [!TIP]
This can certainly work on other platforms with a little code correction, mostly shoutboxs are over socket connections so maybe someone will find this useful for a similar tool.
